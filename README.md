# Crossref REST API

# DEPRECATION NOTICE 

The Crossref REST API has been updated to use Elasticsearch instead of Solr -- read more about that project [here](https://www.crossref.org/blog/behind-the-scenes-improvements-to-the-rest-api/). 

This documentation is **deprecated**. Documentation for the new API can still be found at [https://api.crossref.org/](https://api.crossref.org/), and issues should be filed to the [Crossref issue repository](https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues) in Gitlab.

## Preamble

The Crossref REST API is one of [a variety of tools and APIs](https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/) that allow anybody to search and reuse our members' metadata in sophisticated ways.

If you read nothing else, please at least look at the [API TIPs](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/api_tips.md) document and the ["Etiquette" section](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#etiquette) of this document. It will save you (and us) much heartburn.


## Meta

### Frequency of indexing

Records typically appear in the REST API within 20 minutes of their having been successfully deposited with Crossref.

Summary information (e.g. counts, etc.) are processed in batch every 24 hours.

### Learning about performance or availability problems

We record and report service issues on our [status page](https://status.crossref.org).

You might want to check this to see if we are already aware of a problem before you report it.

We also post notice of any ongoing performance problems with our services on our twitter feeds at [CrossrefOrg](https://twitter.com/CrossrefOrg) and [CrossrefSupport](https://twitter.com/@CrossrefSupport).

### Reporting performance or availability problems

Report performance/availability at our [support site](https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us).

### Reporting bugs, requesting features

Please report bugs with the API or the documentation on our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues).

### Metadata License

Crossref asserts no claims of ownership to individual items of bibliographic metadata and associated Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) acquired through the use of the Crossref Free Services. Individual items of bibliographic metadata and associated DOIs may be cached and incorporated into the user's content and systems.

### Privacy

We also have a [privacy policy](https://www.crossref.org/privacy/).

### Libraries

You might be able to avoid reading all this documentation if you instead use one of the several excellent libraries that have been written for the Crossref REST API. For example:

- [crossref-commons](https://gitlab.com/crossref/crossref_commons_py) (Python, developed by Crossref)
- [habanero](https://github.com/sckott/habanero) (Python)
- [serrano](https://github.com/sckott/serrano) (Ruby)
- [rcrossref](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref) (R)
- [crossrefapi](https://github.com/fabiobatalha/crossrefapi) (Python)
- [crossref-rs](https://github.com/MattsSe/crossref-rs) (rust)
- [pitaya](https://github.com/naustica/Pitaya) (Julia)

If you know of another library you would like to see listed here, please let us know about it via the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues).

### Etiquette

We want to provide a public, open, and free API for all. And we don't want to unnecessarily burden developers (or ourselves) with cumbersome API tokens or registration processes in order to use the public REST API. For that to work, we ask that you be polite and try not to do anything that will take the public REST API down or otherwise make it unusable for others. Specifically, we encourage the following polite behaviour:

- Cache data so you don't request the same data over and over again.
- Actively monitor API response times. If they start to go up, back-off for a while. For example, add pauses between requests and/or reduce the number of parallel requests.
- Specify a `User-Agent` header that properly identifies your script or tool and that provides a means of contacting you via email using "mailto:". For example:
`GroovyBib/1.1 (https://example.org/GroovyBib/; mailto:GroovyBib@example.org) BasedOnFunkyLib/1.4`.

This way we can contact you if we see a problem.

- report problems and/or ask questions on our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues).

Alas, not all people are polite. And for this reason we reserve the right to impose rate limits and/or to block clients that are disrupting the public service.

### Good manners = more reliable service.

But we prefer carrots to sticks. As of September 18th 2017 any API queries that **use HTTPS and have appropriate contact information** will be directed to a special pool of API machines that are reserved for polite users.

Why are we doing this? Well- we don't want to force users to have to register with us. But this means that if some user of the public server writes a buggy script or ignores timeouts and errors- they can really bring the API service to its knees. What's more, it is very hard for us to identify these problem users because they tend to work off multiple parallel machines and use generic User-Agent headers. They are effectively anonymous. We're starting to have to spend a lot of time dealing with these problems and the degraded performance of the public API is affecting all the polite users as well.

So... we are keeping the public service as is. It will probably continue to fluctuate widely in performance. But now, if a client connects to the API using HTTPS and provides contact information either in their User-Agent header or as a parameter on their queries, then we will send them to a separate pool of machines. We expect to be able to better control the performance of these machines because, if a script starts causing problems, we can contact the people responsible for the script to ask them to fix it. Or, in extremis, we can block it.

How does it work? Simple. You can do one of two things to get directed to the "polite pool":

1) Include a "mailto" parameter in your query. For example:

`https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=has-full-text:true&mailto=GroovyBib@example.org`

2) Include a "mailto:" in your User-Agent header. For example:

`GroovyBib/1.1 (https://example.org/GroovyBib/; mailto:GroovyBib@example.org) BasedOnFunkyLib/1.4`.

Note that this only works if you query the API using HTTPS. You really should be doing that anyway (wags finger).

##### Frequently anticipated questions

**Q:** Will you spam me with marketing [bumf](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bumf) once you have our contact info?

**A:** No. We will only use it to contact you about problems with your scripts.


**Q:** Is this a secret plot to kill public access to your API?

**A:** No. It is an attempt to keep the public API reliable.


**Q:** What if I provide fake or incorrect contact info?

**A:** That is not very polite. If there is a problem and you don't respond, we'll block you.


**Q:** Does the contact info have to be a real name?

**A:** No. As long as somebody actually receives and pays attention to email at the address, it can be pseudo-anonymous, or whatever.



#### Rate limits

From time to time Crossref needs to impose rate limits to ensure that the free API is usable by all. Any rate limits that are in effect will be advertised in the `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` and `X-Rate-Limit-Interval` HTTP headers.

For ease-of-parsing, the `X-Rate-Limit-Interval` will always be expressed in seconds. So, for example the following tells you that you should expect to be able to perform 50 requests a second:

```
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 50
X-Rate-Limit-Interval: 1s
```

Note that if we wanted to adjust the measurement window, we could specify:

```
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 3000
X-Rate-Limit-Interval: 60s
```


#### Blocking

This is always our last resort, and you can generally avoid it if you include contact information in the `User-Agent` header or `mailto` parameter as described above.

But seriously... this is a bummer. We really want you to use the API. If you are polite about it, you shouldn't have any problems.

### Use for production services

What if you want to use our API for a production service that cannot depend on the performance uncertainties of the free and open public API? What if you don't want to be affected by impolite people who do not follow the [API Etiquette](#api-etiquette) guidelines? Well, if youâ€™re interested in using these tools or APIs for production services, we [have a service-level offering](https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/plus-service/) called "Plus". This service provides you with access to all supported APIs and metadata, but with extra service and support guarantees.

#### Authorization token for Plus service

When you sign up for the Plus service, you will be issued an API token that you should put in the `Authorization` header of all your rest API requests. This token will ensure that said requests get directed to a pool of machines that are reserved for "Plus" SLA users. For example, with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/):

```
curl -X GET \
  https://api.crossref.org/works \
  -H 'Crossref-Plus-API-Token: Bearer yJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vY3Jvc3NyZWYub3JnLyIsImF1ZXYZImVuaGFuY2VkY21zIiwianRpIjoiN0M5ODlFNTItMTFEQS00QkY3LUJCRUUtODFCMUM3QzE0OTZEIn0.NYe3-O066sce9R1fjMzNEvP88VqSEaYdBY622FDiG8Uq' \
  -H 'User-Agent: GroovyBib/1.1 (https://example.org/GroovyBib/; mailto:GroovyBib@example.org) BasedOnFunkyLib/1.4'
```

Note that you can still be "polite" and identify yourself as well. And, of course, replace the fake token above with the real token.

## API overview

The API is generally RESTFUL and returns results in JSON. JSON formats returned by the API are documented [here](https://github.com/Crossref/rest-api-doc/blob/master/api_format.md).

The API supports HTTP and HTTPS. Examples here are provided using HTTPS.

You should always url-encode DOIs and parameter values when using the API. DOIs are notorious for including characters that break URLs (e.g. semicolons, hashes, slashes, ampersands, question marks, etc.).

Note url-encoding applies to cursors as well since they too are likely to include characters that will break URLs (e.g. `+` symbol)

Note that, for the sake of clarity, the examples in this document do *not* url-encode DOIs or parameter values.

The API will only work for Crossref DOIs. You can test the registration agency for a DOI using the following route:

`https://api.crossref.org/works/{doi}/agency`

Testing the following Crossref DOI:

`10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.29`

Using the URL:

`https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.29/agency`

Will return the following result:

    {
      status: "ok",
      message-type: "work-agency",
      message-version: "1.0.0",
      message: {
        DOI: "10.1037/0003-066x.59.1.29",
        agency: {
          id: "crossref",
          label: "Crossref"
        }
      }
    }

If you use any of the API calls listed below with a non-Crossref DOI, you will get a `404` HTTP status response. Typical agency IDs include `crossref`, `datacite`, `medra` and also `public` for test DOIs.

## Result types

All results are returned in JSON. There are three general types of results:

- Singletons
- Headers-only
- Lists

The mime-type for API results is `application/vnd.crossref-api-message+json`

### Singletons

Singletons are single results. Retrieving metadata for a specific identifier (e.g. DOI, ISSN, funder_identifier) typically returns in a singleton result.

### Headers only

You can use HTTP HEAD requests to quickly determine "existence" of a singleton. The advantage of this technique is that it is very fast because it does not return any metadata- it only returns headers and an HTTP status code (200=exists, 404=does not exist).

To determine if member ID `98` exists:

`curl --head "https://api.crossref.org/members/98"`

To determine if a journal with ISSN `1549-7712` exists:

`curl --head "https://api.crossref.org/journals/1549-7712"`

### Lists
Lists results can contain multiple entries. Searching or filtering typically returns a list result. A list has two parts:

- Summary, which include the following information:

    - status (e.g. "ok", error)
    - message-type (e.g. "work-list" )
    - message-version (e.g. 1.0.0 )

- Items, which will will contain the items matching the query or filter.

Note that the "message-type" returned will differ from the mime-type:

- funder (singleton)
- prefix (singleton)
- member (singleton)
- work (singleton)
- work-list (list)
- funder-list (list)
- prefix-list (list)
- member-list (list)

Normally, an API list result will return both the summary and the items. If you want to just retrieve the summary, you can do so by specifying that the number of rows returned should be zero.

#### Sort order

If the API call includes a query, then the sort order will be by the relevance score. If no query is included, then the sort order will be by DOI update date.

### Selecting which elements to return

Crossref metadata records can be quite large. Sometimes you just want a few elements from the schema. You can "select" a subset of elements to return using the `select` parameter. This can make your API calls much more efficient. For example:

`https://api.crossref.org/works?sample=10&select=DOI,title`


## Resource components
Major resource components supported by the Crossref API are:

- works
- funders
- members
- prefixes
- types
- journals

These can be used alone like this

| resource      | description                       |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------|
| `/works`      | returns a list of all works (journal articles, conference proceedings, books, components, etc), 20 per page
| `/funders`    | returns a list of all funders in the [Funder Registry](https://github.com/Crossref/open-funder-registry)
| `/members` | returns a list of all Crossref members (mostly publishers) |
| `/types`      | returns a list of valid work types |
| `/licenses`  | return a list of licenses applied to works in Crossref metadata |
| `/journals` | return a list of journals in the Crossref database |


### Resource components and identifiers
Resource components can be used in conjunction with identifiers to retrieve the metadata for that identifier.

| resource                    | description                       |
|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| `/works/{doi}`              | returns metadata for the specified Crossref DOI. |
| `/funders/{funder_id}`      | returns metadata for specified funder **and** its suborganizations |
| `/prefixes/{owner_prefix}` | returns metadata for the DOI owner prefix |
| `/members/{member_id}` | returns metadata for a Crossref member |
| `/types/{type_id}` | returns information about a metadata work type |
| `/journals/{issn}` | returns information about a journal with the given ISSN |

### Combining resource components

The works component can be appended to other resources.

| resource                    | description                       |
|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| `/works/{doi}`      | returns information about the specified Crossref `DOI` |
| `/funders/{funder_id}/works`| returns list of works associated with the specified `funder_id` |
| `/types/{type_id}/works` | returns list of works of type `type` |
| `/prefixes/{owner_prefix}/works` | returns list of works associated with specified `owner_prefix` |
| `/members/{member_id}/works` | returns list of works associated with a Crossref member (deposited by a Crossref member) |
| `/journals/{issn}/works` | returns a list of works in the given journal |

## Parameters

Parameters can be used to query, filter and control the results returned by the Crossref API. They can be passed as normal URI parameters or as JSON in the body of the request.

| parameter                    | description                 |
|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------|
| `query`                      | query terms |
| `filter={filter_name}:{value}`| filter results by specific fields |
| `rows={#}`                   | results per page |
| `offset={#}` (max 10k)               | result offset (use `cursor` for larger `/works` result sets)  |
| `sample={#}` (max 100)                | return random N results |
| `sort={#}`                   | sort results by a certain field |
| `order={#}`                  | set the sort order to `asc` or `desc` |
| `facet={#}`                    | enable facet information in responses |
| `cursor={#}`             | deep page through `/works` result sets |

Multiple filters can be specified by separating name:value pairs with a comma:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=has-orcid:true,from-pub-date:2004-04-04

### Example query using URI parameters

    https://api.crossref.org/funders/100000015/works?query=global+state&filter=has-orcid:true&rows=1

## Queries

Free form search queries can be made, for example, works that include `renear` and `ontologies`:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?query=renear+ontologies

## Field Queries

Field queries are available on the `/works` route and allow for queries that match only particular fields
of metadata. For example, this query matches records that contain the tokens `richard` or `feynman` (or both)
in any author field:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?query.author=richard+feynman

Field queries can be combined with the general `query` paramter and each other. Each query parameter
is ANDed with the others:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?query.bibliographic=room+at+the+bottom&query.author=richard+feynman

### `/works` Field Queries

These field queries are available on the `/works` route:

| Field query parameter | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `query.container-title` | Query `container-title` aka. publication name |
| `query.author` | Query author given and family names |
| `query.editor` | Query editor given and family names |
| `query.chair` | Query chair given and family names |
| `query.translator` | Query translator given and family names |
| `query.contributor` | Query author, editor, chair and translator given and family names |
| `query.bibliographic` | Query bibliographic information, useful for citation look up. Includes titles, authors, ISSNs and publication years |
| `query.affiliation` | Query contributor affiliations |

Note that `query.title` has been deprecated and is no longer available. Please use `query.bibliographic` instead.

## Sorting

Results from a listy response can be sorted by applying the `sort` and `order` parameters. Order
sets the result ordering, either `asc` or `desc`. Sort sets the field by which results will be
sorted. Possible values are:

| Sort value | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `score` or `relevance` | Sort by relevance score |
| `updated` | Sort by date of most recent change to metadata. Currently the same as `deposited`. |
| `deposited` | Sort by time of most recent deposit |
| `indexed` | Sort by time of most recent index |
| `published` | Sort by publication date |
| `published-print` | Sort by print publication date |
| `published-online` | Sort by online publication date |
| `issued` | Sort by issued date (earliest known publication date) |
| `is-referenced-by-count` | Sort by number of times this DOI is referenced by other Crossref DOIs |
| `references-count` | Sort by number of references included in the references section of the document identified by this DOI |

An example that sorts results in order of publication, beginning with the least recent:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?query=josiah+carberry&sort=published&order=asc

## Facet counts

Facet counts can be retrieved by enabling faceting. Facets are enabled by providing facet field names along with a maximum number of returned term values. The larger the number of returned values, the longer the query will take. Some facet fields
can accept a `*` as their maximum, which indicates that all values should be returned.

Facets are specified with the `facet` parameter:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?rows=0&facet=type-name:*

| Facet name | Maximum values | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------|-------------|
| `affiliation` | `*` | Author affiliation |
| `funder-name` | `*` | Funder literal name as deposited alongside DOIs |
| `funder-doi` | `*` | Funder DOI |
| `orcid` | 100 | Contributor ORCID |
| `container-title` | 100 | Work container title, such as journal title, or book title |
| `assertion` | `*` | Custom Crossmark assertion name |
| `archive` | `*` | Archive location |
| `update-type` | `*` | Significant update type |
| `issn` | 100 | Journal ISSN (any - print, electronic, link) |
| `published` | `*` | Earliest year of publication |
| `type-name` | `*` | Work type name, such as `journal-article` or `book-chapter` |
| `license` | `*` | License URI of work |
| `category-name` | `*` | Category name of work |
| `relation-type` | `*` | Relation type described by work or described by another work with work as object |
| `assertion-group` | `*` | Custom Crossmark assertion group name |
| `publisher-name` | `*` | Publisher name of work |

### Multiple filters

Multiple filters can be specified in a single query. In such a case, different filters will be applied with AND semantics, while specifying the same filter multiple times will result in OR semantics - that is, specifying the filters:

- `is-update:true`
- `from-pub-date:2014-03-03`
- `funder:10.13039/100000001`
- `funder:10.13039/100000050`

would locate documents that are updates, were published on or after 3rd March 2014 and were funded by either the National Science Foundation (`10.13039/100000001`) or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (`10.13039/100000050`). These filters would be specified by joining each filter together with a comma:

    /works?filter=is-update:true,from-pub-date:2014-03-03,funder:10.13039/100000001,funder:10.13039/100000050

### Dot filters

A filter with a dot in its name is special. The dot signifies that the filter will be applied to some other record type that is related to primary resource record type. For example, with work queries, one can filter on works that have an award, where the same award has a particular award number and award-giving funding agency:

    /works?filter=award.number:CBET-0756451,award.funder:10.13039/100000001

Here we filter on works that have an award by the National Science Foundation that also has the award number `CBET-0756451`.

### Notes on owner prefixes

The prefix of a Crossref DOI does **NOT** indicate who currently owns the DOI. It only reflects who originally registered the DOI. Crossref metadata has an **owner_prefix** element that records the current owner of the Crossref DOI in question.

Crossref also has member IDs for depositing organisations. A single member may control multiple owner prefixes, which in turn may control a number of DOIs. When looking at works published by a certain organisaton, member IDs and the member routes should be used.

### Notes on dates

Note that dates in filters should always be of the form `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY`. Also note that date information in Crossref metadata can often be incomplete. So, for example, a publisher may only include the year and month of publication for a journal article. For a monograph they might just include the year. In these cases the API selects the earliest possible date given the information provided. So, for instance, if the publisher only provided 2013-02 as the published date, then the date would be treated as 2013-02-01. Similarly, if the publisher only provided the year 2013 as the date, it would be treated at 2013-01-01.

### Notes on incremental metadata updates

When using time filters to retrieve periodic, incremental metadata updates,
the `from-index-date` filter should be used over `from-update-date`,
`from-deposit-date`, `from-created-date` and `from-pub-date`. The
timestamp that `from-index-date` filters on is guaranteed to be updated
every time there is a change to metadata requiring a reindex.

## Result controls

You can control the delivery and selection results using the `rows`, `offset` and `sample` parameters.

 If you are expecting results beyond 10K, then use a `cursor` to deep page through the results. Note that not all routes support cursors.

### Rows

Normally, results are returned 20 at a time. You can control the number of results returns by using the `rows` parameter. To limit results to 5, for example, you could do the following:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?query=allen+renear&rows=5

If you would just like to get the `summary` of the results, you can set the rows to 0 (zero).

    https://api.crossref.org/works?query=allen+renear&rows=0

The maximum number rows you can ask for in one query is `1000`.

### Offset

The number of returned items is controlled by the `rows` parameter, but you can select the offset into the result list by using the `offset` parameter.  So, for example, to select the second set of 5 results (i.e. results 6 through 10), you would do the following:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?query=allen+renear&rows=5&offset=5

Offsets for `/works` are limited to 10K. Use `cursor` (see below) for larger `/works` results sets.

### Deep paging with cursors

Using large `offset` values can result in extremely long response times. Offsets in the 100,000s and beyond will likely cause a timeout before the API is able to respond. An alternative to paging through very large result sets (like a corpus used for text and data mining) is to use the API's exposure of Solr's deep paging cursors. Any combination of query, filters and facets may be used with deep paging cursors. While `rows` may be specified along with `cursor`, `offset` and `sample` cannot be used. To use deep paging make a query as normal, but include the `cursor` parameter with a value of `*`. In this example we will page through all `journal-article` works from member `311`:

    https://api.crossref.org/members/311/works?filter=type:journal-article&cursor=*

A `next-cursor` field will be provided in the JSON response. To get the next page of results, pass the value of `next-cursor` as the `cursor` parameter. For example:

    https://api.crossref.org/members/311/works?filter=type:journal-article&cursor=AoE/CGh0dHA6Ly9keC5kb2kub3JnLzEwLjEwMDIvdGRtX2xpY2Vuc2VfMQ==

Note that the actual cursor value will be different from this illustration.

Clients should check the number of returned items. If the number of returned items is fewer than the number of expected rows then the end of the result set has been reached. Using `next-cursor` beyond this point will result in responses with an empty items list.

The `cursor` parameter is available on all `/works` resources.

### Sample

Being able to select random results is useful for both testing and sampling. You can use the `sample` parameter to retrieve random results. So, for example, the following select 10 random works:

    https://api.crossref.org/works?sample=10

Note that when you use the `sample` parameter, the `rows` and `offset` parameters are ignored.

## API versioning

In theory, the syntax of the API can vary independently of the result representations. In practice, major version changes in either will require changes to API clients and so versioning of the API will apply to both the API syntax and the result representation.

The API uses a semantic versioning scheme whereby the version number is divided into three parts delimited by periods. The first number represents the "major" release number. The second represents a "minor" release number.

    Version 1.20
            ^  ^
            |  |
        major  |
           minor

 **Major** version increments are defined as releases that can break backwards compatibility. Crossref will only commit to supporting the latest two major releases simultaneously and legacy major releases will be supported for no more than nine months. Exceptions to these rules may be made when major releases are required to ensure the security or stability of the system.

**Minor** version increments are defined as backwards compatible. There is no limit on the number of minor versions that Crossref can roll out. Note that client applications should not have dependencies on minor versions, and Crossref will only maintain the latest minor version for the two most recent major versions.

Adding syntax options or metadata to representations will normally be backwards compatible and will thus normally only trigger minor version changes. Renaming or restructuring syntax options of metadata tends not to be backward compatible and will thus typically trigger major version changes

### How to manage API versions

If you need to tie your implementation to a specific major version of the API, you can do so by using version-specific routes. The default route redirects to the most recent version of the API. Some older major versions may be available using a version prefix. For example, to access version `v1` of the API:

    https://api.crossref.org/v1/works

Each major version has no backwards incompatible changes within its public interface.
